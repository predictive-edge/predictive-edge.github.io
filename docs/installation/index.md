The basic installation process is easy - just copy and paste your tag from the
dashboard,
[here](http://dashboard.predictiveedge.com/app/settings/integration), and
follow the provided instructions.

We recommend the synchronous tag; however, an asynchronous tag is also
available. Their tradeoffs are outlined [here](/docs/installation/tag).

We also support further integration with first-party data for more robust
targeting. For more details, see [here](/docs/datatracking).
